Real Estate Investment Project - Data cleaning and standardization 

This project utilizes data retrieved from Bright MLS regarding multifamily sales data, as well as residential lease data for Camden County, NJ. The goal was to standardize and merge raw data into new tables to provide meaningful insight for investment analysis.

Folder Structure
  1. Raw Data Tables
       Camden County Bottom, Camden County Top, and Multifamily Sales Data(All) are all the     
       necessary data tables regarding the multifamily sales.
       The residential lease data folder contains three folders: Camden County All, Top, and 
       Bottom.
       This is all of the relevant rental data for the same areas as the multifamily data.

  2. Complete Data Tables
       There are 2 folders, Complete Tables, MF and RL. There are 3 tables in each folder, with 
       all 10 data points joined together and standardized.

  3. SQL Scripts
       You will find 2 seperate SQL scripts, one for the multifamily data and one for the 
       residential lease data.

The complete tables will be used in a visualization for the client.
